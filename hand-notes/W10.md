# CS2103 Notes (Week 10)

# Lecture (Week 9 - 18/10)

* Law of Demeter
    - Can still call methods of a parameter
    - It's **okay** to create and do stuff to new objects
        - ** It's okay if `new` is not within in the code
        - As long as it is a new object, not objects that have existed already
    - Heavily hinted that could be in the exam paper
* 4 techniques
    1. Misunderstandings
        - Different interpretations
        - Internal/Developer screwed up
        - **Use assertions to abort**
    2. Mishaps
        - User does not do the right things
        - Safety mechanisms
        - **Use exceptions to handle**
        - E.g. API calls Google server but server down
    3. Mysteries
        - **Use logging**
    4. Misuse
        - **Write defensive code**
        - Actively try to block things
        - Identify holes, actively plug them
        - Make sure it never functions incorrectly
* Types of patterns in SE domain
    1. Singleton
        - Context: One and only one object, shared among others
        - Problem: how to avoid multiple objects
        - Solution: 
            - make the constructor private
            - declare variable of the same time
            - static public method to create object if not yet exist
        - Not so good pattern
    2. Facade
        - Context: component with many internal structures, 
        - Problem: Don't want clients to access them directly
        - Solution: put a class that deals with these
            - E.g. `LogicManager`
        - `<<facade>>`,  `<<client>>`, `<<interface>>`, `<<singleton>>`: roles played by the class (don't know actual name)
    3. Command
* Writing test cases
    - How much information to reveal
        - Glass/white-box: look at code, write tests to test all the branches
        - Gray-box: some information is used
            - Design test cases of different conditions
            - E.g. different algo when more than 1000 objects
        - Black-box
    - Cost
        - There is a cost to testing
        - Effectiveness and efficiency of test (E&E)
            - Effective: find more bugs
            - Efficient: use less test cases
        - A test case should have a reasonable change of finding a new bug not found by the other test cases
    - Equivalence partitioning
        - More than 1 partition can produce the same output
        - E.g. within range, outside range
        - Not necessary to test many cases from one partition
            - increases efficiency
        - Cover all partitions
            - increases effectiveness
    - Boundary value analysis
        - Testing at the boundary (minimally), just outside, just inside
        - Depends on how many test cases you can afford
        - Not applicable for cases when values are not continuous
            - E.g. Prime and not prime numbers
        - Improves E&E
            - Cut down redundant test cases
            - Focus on areas where there are likely to be more bugs
