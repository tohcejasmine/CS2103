# CS2103 Notes

## Week 7

# Week 6 (Lecture - 20/9)

* iP
    - Asymmetric graphics for conversation
    - Since its not really a conversation between 2 people (echoing etc)
* Textual Use Cases
    - _Actor_
    - _Main success scenario_ (steps)
    - _Inclusion_
        - Underline
    - _Extensions_ 
        - E.g. extension to Step 3., as Step 3a.
* Visual Use Cases
    - Actor _generalisation_
        - Something like inheritance
    - Notation for _inclusion_: `--<<include>>-->`
    - Notation for _extension_: `--<<extend>>-->`
        - Not recommended to include
        - Too many to include
* Format
    - Vision
    - Scope
    - User
    - Workflow (broad summary of what each user does)
* API
    - Application Programming Interface
    - As long have a bunch of methods that can call
    - E.g. Application: GitHub
    - E.g. Class: `String`
    - Define APIs systematically to match features
        - Work backwards from features
* Agile Design Approach
    - Start with a minimal high-level design and evolve iteratively as necessary
    - Opposite: full design upfront
    - Because things change, just work on the things that need to be done
    - Decide only when you need a feature
* Design Fundamentals
    1. Abstraction
        - _"Abstraction is broken/leaking"_: Things that are meant to be hidden aren't
    2. Coupling
        - i.e. dependency
        - When
            - If change one class, might need a change in another class
            - If both classes assess the same global variable (not immediately obvious)
                - E.g. When modify content such that other class which uses it no longer works
        - Strong and weak dependency
        - Try to reduce
    3. Cohesion
        - About how tight something is, in a component
        - Increased cohesion, usually leads to better reusability
* Continuous Integration
    - Early and frequent integration, incrementally
    - Order of integration
        - Top-down, bottom-up (use drivers), sandwich (do both and meet halfway)
* Project
    - Build automation (Gradle)
    - Continuous integration (Travis)
    - Continuous deployment (builds a `jar` file every time it releases)
* Buffers
    - Not _padding_ (i.e. allocate more time to task)
    - If task not done by deadline, know that wrongly estimate time
* Forking workflow
    - Add a branch when adding something
