# CS2103 Notes (Week 8)

# Week 7 Lecture (4/10)
 
* Dependency injection
    - Pass in a stub
* Stubs should minimise logic
* Different kind of stubs
    - Stubs that throws errors for all methods
    - Stubs that will always reject
    - Stubs that always
* Can create stubs to inherit from another stub
* Pure unit and integration testing
    - First test the unit that does not depend on anything
    - Create stub and test unit that has dependencies
    - Then integrate test both (units that depend and are depended upon)
* Pure unit testing
    - Many test cases
* Acceptance testing 
    - by user
    - in deployment env
    - requirements specification
        - needs of the users
        - created by the business analysts, designers
* System testing
    - by QA
    - on test bed
    - system specification
        - features of the system
    - done by engineerings, designers
* Flow
    - Unit test with stubs
    - Integration test whenever finish testing 2 unit tests
    - System test
    - Acceptance test
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
    - Write test even before writing code
    - Write code just enough for code to pass
* Important points below
* Testability
    - How easy is it to test our code?
* Test coverage
    - How good are your tests?
    - How much of the code is covered by tests?
* Remember to test GUI well, when doing it manually
* Paths
