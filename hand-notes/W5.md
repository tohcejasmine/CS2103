# CS2103 Notes (Week 5)

# W4 Lecture 6/9

## Resume
* Education
    - If CAP is not high
    - Mention good grades for _relevant_ modules
    - Do tutorships
* Projects
    - _ProjectName_: _description_ (school project)
    - Side-project
    - Contribute to OSS projects (actual production code)
* Competencies
    - Can be tweaked to match the job
    - E.g.

    3 projects, 10 KLoC in total
    used JavaFX, TestFX, Gradle, Travis
    notable PRs: PR1, PRR2

## Requirement Techniques

1. Ask
    - Don't assume, clarify
    - Surveys
    - Interviews
    - Focus groups
    - Ask users, customers, investors, developers, government, stakeholders
2. Invent yourself
    - Study existing products 
    - Observe users
    - Brainstorming
3. Record and specifying techniques
    - Prose (just write it down)
    - User stories
        1. Role (_as a product owner_)
        2. Goal/function (_I want to..._)
        3. Benefit (_so that other users can see..._)
    - Feature list
    - Use cases
        - How user interacts with the system
4. Prototypes
    - Low-fidelity
    - High-fidelity
    - Functional
5. Supplementary requirements
    - Mostly non-functional requirements

# Code Quality

* Learn to follow a standard (objective)
* Comments
    - If you must
    - wrong, tests don't check code, may not be updated
    - good code that are self-explanatory don't really need comments that explain the code 
    - Need comments to explain what the code does, at a higher level
* Avoid magic literals
    - E.g.`SUBSIDY` instead of `250`
* Exploit abstraction
    -SLAP (single level of abstraction per function)
        - Same level of abstraction within a method
    - Use guard conditions
        Reduce nesting of happy path (i.e. main method) of code
* Optimise, if you must
* Messy things get messier
    - Clean up code **frequently**
    - Refactoring
        - Improve program's internal structure
        - In _small_ steps
        - _Without_ modifying its external behaviour

# Continuous integration
