# CS2103 Notes

# Week 3

## JavaDoc
* Tool to generate API documentation in HTML form
* From doc comments in source
* Example of minimal javadoc comment

**For methods:**

    /**
    * Returns lateral location of the specified position.
    * If the position is unset, NaN is returned.
    *
    * @param x  X coordinate of position.
    * @param y Y coordinate of position.
    * @param zone Zone of position.
    * @return Lateral location.
    * @throws IllegalArgumentException  If zone is <= 0.
    */
    public double computeLocation(double x, double y, int zone)
        throws IllegalArgumentException {
    ...
    }
**For classes:**

    package ...

    import ...

    /**
    * Represents a location in a 2D space. A <code>Point</code> object corresponds to
    * a coordinate represented by two integers e.g., <code>3,6</code>
    */
    public class Point{
        //...
    }

**Tips on writing JavaDoc comments:**
* Documentation comment
    - `/** documentation */`
    - Also _doc comment_
    - JDK javadoc tool uses it when preparing automatically generated documentation
<!-- -->
    /**
    * write description of program
    * <h1>can use HTML tags here</h1>
    *
    * @author Jamminity
    * @version 1.0
    * @since 2019-08-23
    */

**Taken from https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm#:**

| javadoc tag | Description | Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@author` | Adds the author of a class | 	`@author name-text` |
| `{@code}` | 	Displays text in code font without interpreting the text as HTML markup or nested javadoc tags | `{@code text}` |
| `{@docRoot}`| Represents the relative path to the generated document's root directory from any generated page | `{@docRoot}` |
| `@deprecated` | Adds a comment indicating that this API should no longer be used | `@deprecated deprecatedtext` |
| `@exception` | Adds a **Throws** subheading to the generated documentation, with the classname and description text | `@exception class-name description` |
| `{@inheritDoc}` | Inherits a comment from the nearest inheritable class or implementable interface | Inherits a comment from the immediate surperclass |
| `{@link}` | Inserts an in-line link with the visible text label that points to the documentation for the specified package, class, or member name of a referenced class | `{@link package.class#member label}` |
| `{@linkplain}` | Identical to {@link}, except the link's label is displayed in plain text than code font | `{@linkplain package.class#member label}` |
| `@param ` | Adds a parameter with the specified parameter-name followed by the specified description to the "Parameters" section | `@param parameter-name description` |
| `@return` | Adds a "Returns" section with the description text | `@return description` |
| `@see` | Adds a "See Also" heading with a link or text entry that points to reference | `@see reference` |
| `@serial` | Used in the doc comment for a default serializable field | `@serial field-description | include | exclude` |
| `@serialData` | Documents the data written by the writeObject( ) or writeExternal( ) methods | `@serialData data-description` |
| `@serialField` | Documents an ObjectStreamField component | `@serialField field-name field-type field-description` |
| `@since` | Adds a "Since" heading with the specified since-text to the generated documentation | `@since release` |
| `@throws` | The @throws and @exception tags are synonyms | `@throws class-name description` |
| `{@value`} | When {@value} is used in the doc comment of a static field, it displays the value of that constant | `{@value package.class#field}` |
| `@version` | Adds a "Version" subheading with the specified version-text to the generated docs when the -version option is used | `@version version-text` |

* Documentation will be produced in HTML file
* Master file with name `index.html` will also be created

    public class AddNum {
    /**
    * This method is used to add two integers. This is
    * a the simplest form of a class method, just to
    * show the usage of various javadoc Tags.

    public int addNum(int numA, int numB) {
        return numA + numB;
    }

    /**

    */

    public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
        AddNum obj = new AddNum();
        int sum = obj.addNum(10, 20);

        System.out.println("Sum of 10 and 20 is :" + sum);
    }
    }

## File Access

* `java.io.file` class
    - Represent file object
    - Access properties of file object
<!-- -->
    import java.io.File;

    // Create File object to represent file
    File f = new File("data/fruits.txt");
    // Backslash by itself has a special meaning, so need additional backslash as an escape character
    File f = new File("data\\fruits.txt");
    // Access file properties
    System.out.println("full path: " + f.getAbsolutePath();
    System.out.println("file exists?: " + f.exists());
    System.out.println("is Directory?: " + f.isDirectory()

* `Scanner` object
    - Read from file using `File` object as source of data
<!-- -->
    import java.util.Scanner;
    import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
    
    File f = new File(filePath);
    Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            printFileContents("data/fruits.txt");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found");
        }
    }

* `java.io.FileWriter`
    - Write to a file
<!-- -->
    import java.io.FileWriter;
    import java.io.IOException;   

    private static void writeToFile(String filePath,String textToAdd) throws IOException {
        // Overwrites file
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(filePath);
        // Appends to file (create file in append mode)
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(filePath, true);
        fw.write(textToAdd);
        // NOTE: need close() method to complete writing operation
        fw.close();
    }

* `java.nio.file.Files`
    - Utility class
    - Provides useful file operations
    - Relies on `java.nio.file.Paths` file to generate `Path` objects that represent file paths
<!-- -->
    // Use Files class
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.nio.file.Files;
    import java.nio.file.Paths;

    public class FilesClassDemo {

        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
            // Copy a file
            Files.copy(Paths.get("data/fruits.txt"), Paths.get("temp/fruits2.txt"));
            // Delete a file
            Files.delete(Paths.get("temp/fruits2.txt"));
        }

    }

## Packages

* Organise _types_ into _packages_
    - _types_: e.g. classes, interfaces, enumerations etc
    - Easier management
* Creating a package
    - Put a package statement at the very top of every source file in package
    - No more than one package statement in each source file
    - Package of a type should match the folder path of the source file
    - Compiler will put `.class` files in a folder structure that matches the package names
* Package name
    - all lower case
    - use dot as separator
    - begin with `java.` or `javax.`
    - e.g. `com.foobar.doohickey.utio` for Internet domain name `foobar.com` (reversed)

**Example:** The Formatter class below (in `<source folder>/seedu/tojava/util/Formatter.java file`) is in the package `seedu.tojava.util`. When it is compiled, the `Formatter.class` file will be in the location `<compiler output folder>/seedu/tojava/util`:
<!-- -->
    package seedu.tojava.util;

    public class Formatter {
        public static final String PREFIX = ">>";

        public static String format(String s){
            return PREFIX + s;
        }
    }

* Using public package member from outside its package, options:
    - _package member_: types contained in the package
    1. Use _fully qualified name_ to refer to member
        - type name prefixed by the package name
        - e.g. `java.io.IOException`
    2. Import package or specific package member
    
**Example:** 2 import statements
* `import seedu.tojava.util.StringParser`
    - imports the class `StringParser` in the `seedu.tojava.util` package
* `import seedu.tojava.frontend.*`
    - imports all the classes in the `seedu.tojava.frontend` package
<!-- -->
    package seedu.tojava;

    import seedu.tojava.util.StringParser;
    import seedu.tojava.frontend.*;

    public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            // Using the fully qualified name to access the Processor class
            // No need to import Processor package
            String status = seedu.tojava.logic.Processor.getStatus();

            // Using the StringParser previously imported
            StringParser sp = new StringParser();

            // Using classes from the tojava.frontend package
            Ui ui = new Ui();
            Message m = new Message();

        }
    }

* Importing package does not import its subpackages
    - Packages do not behave as hierachies
    - using the `.*` only imports the _classes_ in the packages
* Without package statement, type does not have package
    - Not recommended practice
    - Not possible for a type in a package to import a type not in a package
* _static import_
    - Import static members of a type
    - To use imported members without specifying type name

**Example:** Use static imports to import constant `PREFIX` and method `format()` from `seedu.tojava.util.Formatter` class

    import static seedu.tojava.util.Formatter.PREFIX;
    import static seedu.tojava.util.Formatter.format;

    public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            // Instead of using Formatter.format()
            String formatted = format("Hello");
            // Instead of using Formatter.PREFIX
            boolean isFormatted = formatted.startsWith(PREFIX);
            System.out.println(formatted);
        }
    }

* When using commandline to compile/run Java
    - Take package into account
* **Example:** `seedu.tojava.Main` class in defined in the file `Main.java`
* Scenario 1: compiling from `<source folder>`
    - e.g. command: `javac seedu/tojava/Main.java`
* Scenario 2: running from `<compiler output folder>`
    - e.g. command: `java seedu.tojava.Main`

## JAR files

* Java Archive (JAR)
    - how Java applications are typically delivered
    - contains Java classes and other resources
    - e.g. icons, media files etc
* Launch executable JAR file
    - Command: `java -jar <JAR file>`
    - e.g. `java -jar foo.jar`
* IDEs can help to package application as a JAR file

## Coding Standards

* Production code needs to be of high quality
* Better for maintenance of code
* Easier for new members of a company/team to learn
* Consistent style (_style guide_)
    - Make entire code base look like it was written by one person
* Coding standard
    - Usually specific to a programming language
    - Guidelines such as location of braces, indentation styles, naming styles
* IDEs can help to enfore some parts of a coding standard
    - E.g. indentation rules

## Developer Testing

* Definition: testing done by developers themselves
    - Not professional testers or end-users
* Better to do **early testing**
    - Cheaper to fix
    - Cost of fixing bug goes up as it goes closer to product release
    - Process of product development
        - Design development -> Integration -> Deployment
    - Testing of partially developed software
* Bad to delay testing until completion of full product
    - Difficult to locate cause of test case failure
        - Large search space
        - Lines and lines of code
        - Failure could be due to multiple inter-related bugs
    - Could require major rework to fix bug
        - Especially if bug originated during design/requirement specification
        - E.g. faulty design, faulty requirements
    - A bug might 'hide' other bugs
        - Fixing a bug may reveal more bugs
    - Delivery may have to be delayed
        - Given too many bugs found during testing
* Developers testing their own code
    - Good
        - Can be done early, find bug early, cheaper to fix
        - Can be done at lower levels
            - Operation, class level
            - VS Testers: UI level
        - Ability for more thorough testing
            - Developers know expected external behaviour and internal structure of component
        - Force developers to take responsiblity for their own work
    - Bad
        - Developer may test it too 'gently'
            - Subconsciously test only situations he knows to work
        - Developer may be blind to his own mistakes
            - Does not consider a certain combination of input
        - Developer may have understood what SUT is supposed to do in the first place
        - Developer may lack testing expertise

## Unit Testing

* **Test driver**
    - Code that 'drives' SUT for purpose of testing
    - Invoke SUT with test inputs, verify behaviour is as expected
<!-- -->
    public class PayrollTestDriver {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

            //test setup
            Payroll p = new Payroll();

            //test case 1
            p.setEmployees(new String[]{"E001", "E002"});
            // automatically verify the response
            if (p.totalSalary() != 6400) {
                throw new Error("case 1 failed ");
            }

            //test case 2
            p.setEmployees(new String[]{"E001"});
            if (p.totalSalary() != 2300) {
                throw new Error("case 2 failed ");
            }

            //more tests...

            System.out.println("All tests passed");
        }
    }

* **Test automation tools**
* JUnit
    - Tool for automated testing of Java programs

Example of automated test, written using JUnit libraries:
    
    @Test
    public void testTotalSalary(){
        Payroll p = new Payroll();

        //test case 1
        p.setEmployees(new String[]{"E001", "E002"});
        assertEquals(6400, p.totalSalary());

        //test case 2
        p.setEmployees(new String[]{"E001"});
        assertEquals(2300, p.totalSalary());

        //more tests...
    }

* **Unit testing**
    - Testing individual units to sure each piece works correctly
        - E.g. methods, classes, subsystems
    - Common to write more than one unit tests for each public method of a class (in OOP code)
<!-- -->
    // Class with 2 methods
    class Foo{
        String read(){
            //...
        }
        
        void write(String input){
            //...
        }
    }
    // Test class with unit tests for each of the 2 methods
    class FooTest{
        
        @Test
        void read(){
            //a unit test for Foo#read() method
        }
        
        @Test
        void write_emptyInput_exceptionThrown(){
            //a unit tests for Foo#write(String) method
        }  
        
        @Test
        void write_normalInput_writtenCorrectly(){
            //another unit tests for Foo#write(String) method
        }
    }

* What makes a good unit test
    1. Trustworthiness
        - Confident that a passed test means something
        - Follow red, green, refactor cycle
        - Red: all tests fail at beginning
        - Green: tests pass due to specific code written
        - ???
        - If removing one random line still passes the test, the test is leaky
    2. Maintainability
        - Write tests on public code
        - Remove duplication in tests
        - Move parts that can vary (e.g. construction, initialisation) in one place
        - Sometimes may need 2 tests to test a method
    3. Readability
        - Be able to read them as specifications
        - Good naming convention
            - Format: `WhatAreWeTesting_InWhatConditions_WhatAreExpectedResult`
            - E.g. `LogIn_ExistingUsernameWithIncorrectPassword_ShouldReturnMessageWrongPassword`
    - Test layout (AAA pattern)
        1. Arrange
            - All possible preparations for test execution
            - E.g. initialisation, stubbing etc
        2. Act
            - Invoke method being tested
        3. Assert
            - Place for assertion

* **Basic JUnit**

Example:

    // IntPair
    public class IntPair {
        int first;
        int second;

        public IntPair(int first, int second) {
            this.first = first;
            this.second = second;
        }

        public int intDivision() throws Exception {
            if (second == 0){
                throw new Exception("Divisor is zero");
            }
            return first/second;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return first + "," + second;
        }
    }

    // IntPairTest (using JUnit5)
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.fail;

    public class IntPairTest {

        // ***NOTE: Each test method marked with @Test annotation
        @Test
        public void testStringConversion() {
            assertEquals("4,7", new IntPair(4, 7).toString());
        }

        @Test
        public void intDivision_nonZeroDivisor_success() throws Exception {
            // ***NOTE: Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual) methods to compare the expected output with the actual output
            // If they do not match, the test will fail
            // JUnit comes with other similar methods such as Assert.assertNull and Assert.assertTrue
            assertEquals(2, new IntPair(4, 2).intDivision());
            assertEquals(0, new IntPair(1, 2).intDivision());
            assertEquals(0, new IntPair(0, 5).intDivision());
        }

        @Test
        // ***NOTE: Convention for test method names
        // Format: whatIsBeingTested_descriptionOfTestInputs_expectedOutcome
        public void intDivision_zeroDivisor_exceptionThrown() {
            try {
                assertEquals(0, new IntPair(1, 0).intDivision());
                fail(); // the test should not reach this line
            // ***NOTE: Several ways to verify the code throws the correct exception
            // One method here: If the exception is thrown, it will be caught and further verified inside the catch block
            // But if it is not thrown as expected, the test will reach Assert.fail() line and will fail as a result
            } catch (Exception e) {
                assertEquals("Divisor is zero", e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }

* Ways to verify code is throwing the correct exception
TODO

* Using Intellij
    - IDE easiest way to run JUnit tests
    1. `Right-click` folder containing test classes
    2. Choose `'Run all tests...'`

* **Stubs**
    - Stubs can isolate an SUT from its dependencies
    - Proper unit test
        - Unit to be tested in isolation
        - Bugs in dependencies cannot influence the test
    - Have same interface as component it replaces but with a simple implementation such that it is unlikely to have any bugs
    - Mimics the responses of component, but only for a limited set of predetermined inputs
    - Does not know how to respond to any other inputs
    - Hard-coded mimicked responses
        - Not computed or retrieved from elsewhere, e.g. database
<!-- -->
**Example**:

    class Logic {
        Storage s;

        Logic(Storage s) {
            this.s = s;
        }

        String getName(int index) {
            return "Name: " + s.getName(index);
        }
    }

    interface Storage {
        String getName(int index);
    }

    class DatabaseStorage implements Storage {

        @Override
        public String getName(int index) {
            return readValueFromDatabase(index);
        }

        private String readValueFromDatabase(int index) {
            // retrieve name from the database
        }
    }

Dependency:

    Logic logic = new Logic(new DatabaseStorage());
    String name = logic.getName(23);

**Stub** (in place of DatabaseStorage):

    // Same interface
    // Pre-config with hard-coded response
    class StorageStub implements Storage {

        @Override
        public String getName(int index) {
            if(index == 5) {
                return "Adam";
            } else {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
            }
        }
    }

* **Pure Unit test** (using stub):
<!-- -->

    @Test
    void getName() {
        Logic logic = new Logic(new StorageStub());
        assertEquals("Name: Adam", logic.getName(5));
    }

* Alternatives to stubs
    - Mocks, Fakes, Dummies, Spies

## Branching

* Process of evolving _multiple versions of software_ in parallel
* Examples of names of branches
    - `master`, `release`, `dev`
* Branches can be merged into another branch
    - Usually results in a new commit that represents changes done in branch being merged
* Merge conflicts
    - Happen when trying to merge 2 branches that changed the same part of the code
    - Need to 'resolve' these conflicts manually
* Git
<!-- -->
| Command | Description |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git status` | By default, on branch `master` | |
| `git branch feature1 && git checkout feature1` | Create new branch and switch to it | |
| `git checkout -b feature1` | Shortcut | |
| | Create commits in new branch | |
| `git checkout master` | Switch to `master` branch | Changes done in branch no longer in working directory |
| | Switch back to branch | |
| `git merge master` | Merge `master` branch to feature branch, Git creates a _merge commit_ | Changes in `master` branch now available even in feature branch |
| | Switch to `master` branch | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git push origin branch3` | Push branch to remote repo/fork |  |

* _fast-forward merge_
    - Git does this if possible
    - Happens when `master` branch has not changed since the start of the branch
    - Just put commits of branch in front of `master` branch, without the trouble of creating an extra merge commit
    - To avoid: `git merge --no-ff feature2`
* Merge conflicts

**Example of a conflicted file:**

    COLORS
    ------
    blue
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    black
    =======
    green
    >>>>>>> fix1
    red
    white

* Conflicted parts is marked with lines starting with `<<<<<<<` and ending with `>>>>>>>`, separated by `=======`
* Conflicting part coming from `master` branch is between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`
* Conflicting part coming from `fix1` branch is between `=======` and `>>>>>>> fix1`
* Resolve conflict by editing file
* End by staging the change and committing

## Pull Request
1. Fork remote repo on GitHub
2. Clone forked repo onto computer
3. Make changes to repo
4. Create pull request
    - Go to GitHub page of fork
    - Click on `Pull Requests` tab
    - Click on `New Pull Request` button
    - Select `base fork` (**your** own fork), where changes should be applied and `head fork` (your own fork, contains chnges you would like to be applied)
    - Confirm the _diff_ contains changes you propose to merge in the PR (i.e. confirm did not accidentally include extra commits in the branch)
    - Click the green `Create pull request` button
    - Set PR name and description
    - Click green `Create pull request` button
* Common mistake when creating branch-based PRs is to mix commits of one PR with another
    - When creating new branch, **switch back to `master`** first
    - Avoid creating new branch on branch
    - Problem later, having commits of first PR in second PR as well

# Week 3 (Lecture - 30/8)

* Watch webcast till 20min

## Models

* Not the actual thing
* Capture different things
* Combat complexity
* Indispensable for bigger projects

* Unified Modeling Language (UML)
* Purpose of models
    1. Analysis
        - To represent what we think is going on
    2. Communication
        - Document, make a record of it
        - So that others don't have to go through it again
    3. Blueprint
        - When building system, follow model
* In CS2103, models mostly used for communication

## UML

1. Modelling structure
    - Class structure/diagrams
    - Object structure/diagrams
    - Initial stage in CS2103, learning to intepret/understand them and comment
2. Modelling behaviour
-----
- Objects
    - Underlined heading
    - Object structure has to obey class diagram (to identify if it is from the same system)
- Class diagrams
    - Associations by a line connecting classes
-----
- Multiplicity
    - TODO: insert multiplicity table
- Roles
    - What is the role of the class in the association
- Labels
    - To expand on association
    - E.g. "keeps track of >" or "< is tracked by"
    - Contains direction to read
- Navigability
- Inheritance
    - Triangle, not arrow
- Composition    
    - Filled diamond: cannot exist without
    - Arrow points to class that cannot exist
    - Diamond at class that is necessary
    - No necessary class, no other class
- Aggregation
    - Empty diamond
    - Container-containee relationship
    - Not really useful and adds value
- Dependency
    - Dotted arrow
    - Starts from class that requires depends
    - Points to class that is depended on
    - Transient, temporary interaction (like in terms of parameters)
- Association classes
    - E.g. Loan class tracks student and book objects, instead of student tracking books
- Abstract classes/methods
    - Format: classname(){abstract}
- Notes
    - Can be floating
- Interfaces
    - Shown as a dash line with triangle
    - Different from solid line and triangle

## Managing Pull Requests

- Review and approval PR, GitHub merges on the site itself

## Team Project

- Strategy: narrowly-defined target user
   - Might be useful to use a specific user persona
