# CS2103 Notes (Week 11)

## Week 10 (Lecture - 25/10)

* Design pattern: observer pattern
    - **D** in **SOLID**: Dependency Inversion Principle
    - Reverse the dependency
    - E.g. _addListener()_
        - When this changes, call this function
    - E.g. _handleExit_
* Don't try to force patterns
* Facade pattern is supposed to reduce coupling
-----
* Architectural patterns
    - Design by architects
    - Patterns, but for architects
    - Different styles
        - Can be mixed
    1. n-tier
    2. transaction processing
        - dispatchers
        - E.g. bank (ATM, bank tellers) send transaction details so they can be processed one by one
    3. event-driven
        - Listeners
    4. client-server
        - GUI
        - E.g. web applications
            - Clicks on something, many events occur, other components listening for click event
* Many different possibilities for test cases
    - Test every possible value at least one
    - E.g. Minimally 3 times (each row, cheapest strategy)
    - E.g. Case 2, not sure if `male` and `slow` works because `medium` is the one definitely causing the error
    - **All valid inputs must appear at least once in a positive test case**
    - **No more than 1 invalid input in a test case**
    - Low probability (risk than can be taken) that combination of all valid gives a valid
        - Rare that individually they are invalid but combination/pairs of inputs cause a valid output
* Quality Assurance
    - Both are important
        - Especially validation because buggy code can be fixed
    - Validation: _Are we building the correct product?_
        - Buggy requirements
    - Verification: _Are we building the product correctly?_
        - Buggy code
* Testing can _never_ prove the absence of bugs but can prove the presence of bugs
* Formal methods
    - Mathematically analysing
    - Prove that something works definitely
    - But takes so much resources (time, money) for something simple
    - But important for software that are extremely crucial
        - E.g. airplane, nuclear software
        - Worth it
* Dynamic Analysis
    - Run the code then can find out what's going on
-----
* Reuse
    - Framework; something like a big part of an application which you can modify to your needs
    - Framework has the control, decided when to call your code
        - _Inversion of control_
        - Opposite of using libraries: _you_ call the code
* Deciding characteristic is runtime environment
* Enterprise application platforms
    - Not installed in your computer
    - Need to do many additional things
        - Security, connection
        - Load balancing
        - But common to many enterprise applications
* Library, framework, platform
* JUnit
    - Both a library and framework
    - Has API to call
    - Running by JUnit, just fill in test cases
