# Week 6

# Week 5 (Lecture - 13/9)

 * Doc comments should not include where the method will be used, because no control over it
 * Method doc comments
    - Verbs: _runs_, _constructs_
 * When defining methods, defining new vocabulary for readers
        - E.g. method name, variable names
        - Nouns and verbs
* SLAP
    - 2 levels is still all right
* Good code looks neat
* Learn smarter
    - Find out about things
    - At least what it does
    - When the time comes, can just find out more on how to use it
* Learn gradually at your own pace

## Modeling: Sequence Diagrams

* Interactions between components for a given scenario
* Self-call and call-backs
* Alternative paths (`if-else`) and optional paths (`if`)

## Modeling: Architecture Diagrams

* High-level structure
* Important technical decisions
    - E.g. servers
* Multi-level design
    - Class diagrams that do not span entire system
    - Instead OOP Component Design
    - For each component, focus only on it
        - Methods within it
    - Connect to components (i.e. classes) it calls with an arrow to a general box

## Product Design

* Personal, subjective observations about product design
* Everything you do should add value to the user
    - Not for your learning
* Minimise work for users
* Think from the user's point of view
    - To get the features
* Simple, the better
* Some users don't like flexibility and making choices
* Don't force users to read the user manual
    - Populate with well-chosen sample data
    - Contextual tups
    - Informative error messages
* Handle user input errors
* Focus on the benefits, not the features
* Visualise usage
    - Personas
    - Situation, context of use
    - First use: sample data? Tutorial?
    - Second and more use?
* Biggest aspect: **care** for the users
    - Figure out what users want
    - Main thing is that users have to like it

## Logging

* Keep record of what happen
* `log()`
    - E.g. `log(LEVEL_INFO, "Setting size to small")`
    - E.g.`log(LEVEL_WARN, "Size not recognised")`
* Can control what levels to show (e.g. when system is more developed, just show warnings)

## Breakpoints
* In IDE
* Specify the breakpoint
* Run program in debug mode
* Stops at breakpoint
* Shows values of variables at that point
* Can show values in next line etc.

## IDE Shortcuts

* `ctrl-Shift-v`: show list of things copied
* `ctrl-Shift-n`: find a method by search
