# CS2103 Notes (Week 8)

# Week 7 Lecture (4/10)
 
* Dependency injection
    - Pass in a stub
* Stubs should minimise logic
* Different kind of stubs
    - Stubs that throws errors for all methods
    - Stubs that will always reject
    - Stubs that always
* Can create stubs to inherit from another stub
* Pure unit and integration testing
    - First test the unit that does not depend on anything
    - Create stub and test unit that has dependencies
    - Then integrate test both (units that depend and are depended upon)
* Pure unit testing
    - Many test cases
* Acceptance testing 
    - by user
    - in deployment env
    - requirements specification
        - needs of the users
        - created by the business analysts, designers
* System testing
    - by QA
    - on test bed
    - system specification
        - features of the system
    - done by engineerings, designers
* Flow
    - Unit test with stubs
    - Integration test whenever finish testing 2 unit tests
    - System test
    - Acceptance test
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
    - Write test even before writing code
    - Write code just enough for code to pass
* Important points below
* Testability
    - How easy is it to test our code?
* Test coverage
    - How good are your tests?
    - How much of the code is covered by tests?
* Remember to test GUI well, when doing it manually
* Paths

# Testing: Types

* Different types of testing, different aspects/performance of software to check

## Integration Testing

* Definition: testing whether different parts of the software work together (i.e. integrates) as expected
* Aim to discover bugs in the 'glue code', related to how components interact with each other
    - Bugs often the result of misunderstanding of what the parts are supposed to do _vs_ what the parts are actually doing
    - E.g. Assumptions: class `Car` assume class `Wheel` can support 200 mph but actually its only 150 mph
* How: not simply a case of repeating the unit test cases using actual dependencies (i.e. no longer using stubs)
    - integration tests are **additional test cases** that **focus on the interactions between the parts**
* Flow of **pure** integration tests:
    - Example: class `car` uses classes `Engine` and `Wheel`
    1. Unit test classes that have no dependencies
        - Unit test `Engine` and `Wheel`
    2. Unit test classes that have dependencies, use stubs in place of classes depended on
        - Unit test `Car` in isolation of `Engine` and `Wheel`, using stubs for them
    3. Integration test all classes
        - Do an integration test for `Car`, using it together with classes `Engine` and `Wheel` to ensure `Car` integrates properly with them
* **In practice,** developers often use a hybrid of *unit + integration* tests to minimise the need for stubs
* Flow of **hybrid** integration tests:
    - Example: _(same as above)_
    1. Unit test classes that have no dependencies _(same)_
        - Unit test `Engine` and `Wheel`
    2. Do an integration test for all classes
        - Do an integration test for `Car`, using it together with classes `Engine` and `Wheel` to ensure that `Car` integrates properly with them
        - **Include in test cases that are meant to test the unit `Car` (i.e. test cases in above part 2 of pure workflow)** 
        - Also include test cases testing the integration of `Car` with `Wheel` and `Engine` (i.e. test cases in above part 3 of pure workflow)
    - No longer need stubs for depended classes
        - Example: `Engine` and `Wheel`
    - Downside: Class with dependencies never tested in isolation of its dependencies
        - Example: `Car`
    - Good: risk of bugs in dependency classes affecting the class depending on them is minimal, since they are already unit tested
