# CS2103 Notes (Week 9)

# Week 8 (Lecture - 11/10)

* Activity diagram
    - **Fork**
        - Indicates parallel paths
    - **Branch**
        - Only can have 2 paths from a branch
    - **Rakes**
        - Non-examinable
    - **Swim lanes**
        - Non-examinable
        - Add-on
        - Show _who_ is only doing what actions
* Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
    - Open for extension: Should be able to extend (use the same code and add-on to it) and use it
    - Closed for modification: should not modify the code itself
        - Because other things coupled to it might be affected by changes in code
* Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Must be substitutable for base classes
    - If parent class has some restrictions (e.g. can only accept number from 1 to 100)
    - Child class should **not** be more restrictive than the parent (e.g. can only accept number from 1 to 10)
* Law of Demeter
    - E.g. `//B` is not good because `Seller` should not know that the money is in the `Wallet` (money could be somewhere else)
    - Should be hidden within `getPayment()`
<!-- -->
    class Seller {
        void getPayment(Customer c, double amount) {
            // A
            Money payment = c.getPayment(amount);
            // B
            Money payment = c.getWallet().getPayment(amount);
        }
    }

* **Sequential/Waterfall**
    - One phase produces something that leads/allows the startof the    next phase
    - Initially buggy
        - E.g. box not stable
    - If requirements are well-understood, fixed and effort predictable
    - Especially if there is a high cost of deploying a 95% completed product
        - E.g. space shuttle 
* **Iterative**
    - If requirements fuzzy and evolving
    1. Iterative (breadth-first)
        - Product appears very fast
        - Initialise all components first
    2. Iterative (depth-first)
        - Appears component by 

------

* Agile processes
    - **NOT** 'high ceremony' processes (i.e. not heavy-weight)
    - E.g. XP (Extreme Programming), Scrum
* Scrum
    - Choose tasks to do in backlog
    - Complete in a sprint/iteration
        - Produce a potential product
    - Regulates the project
        - Pause and take stock
* Types of Documentation
    1. Tutorials
        - Teaching newcomer how to use app
    2. How-to Guides
        - Series of steps on achieving/completing a specific task
    3. Explanation
        - Helps to understand context, background, reasons
    4. Reference
        - Lots of information, describes structure, accurate, complete
    - Minimise (as much as necessary)
    - Top-down explaining
    - Docs from code, not writing it yourself (better chance of being updated)
    - UML Diagrams mainly used for communication
        - Don't expend unnecessary effort
    - Document only stable things
    - Comprehensible for guides
    - Comprehensive for references
    - Remember the purpose
        - tP: for explaining, communication, to be judged by reader, convey message
        - Adjust effort accordingly
        - Include several _types_ of diagrams
            - *What you could have done (possible alternative), explain with a different diagram
