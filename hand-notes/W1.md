# CS2103 Notes
# Week 1

## Overload Constructors
    public Time() {
        this(0, 0, 0);
    }
    public Time(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.seconds = second;
    }

## Convert double to int using `int`
    x = (int)2.25 // x=2

## Math functions
    Math.PI // Get value of Pi
    Math.pow(x, y) // Raise x to the power of y
    Math.max(x, y)


## Remember getters and setters

## Basic Java program template ***
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // ...
            System.out.println(...);
        }
    }

    class Circle {
        // Attributes
        private int hour;
        private int minute;
        private int second;
        
        // Class-level attributes
        private static int numOfCircle = 0;

        // Constructors
        public Circle() {
            this.hour = 0;
            // ...
        }
        // Getters
        public int getHour() {
            return hour;
        }
        // Setters
        public void setHour(int hour) {
            this.hour = hour;
        }
        
    }

    // Inheritance and child class
    class Oval extends Circle {
        public Oval() {
            // Must be in the first line of subclass constructor
            super(); //***
        }
    }

## Enumerations
* Fixed set of values that can be considered as a data type
* Similar to setting levels in a factor in R
* Prevents assignment of invalid values/levels
<!-- To insert code after a list item -->
    public enum Day {
        // Constants, so uppercase
        SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
    }

    Day today = Day.MONDAY;
    Day[] holidays = new Day[]{Day.SATURDAY, Day.SUNDAY};

    switch (today) {
        case SATURDAY:
        case SUNDAY:
            System.out.println("It's the weekend");
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("It's a week day");
    }

## Type Signature
* Type sequence of the parameters of a method

## Ways to create an array
1.

    Animal[] animals = new Animal[]{
        new Cat("Mittens"),
        new Dog("Spot")
    };
2.

    Shape[] shapes = new Shape[100];

## Abstract Classes
* Class cannot be instantiated, but can be subclasses
* E.g. Animal as generalisation of subclasses Cat, Dog, Horse, Tiger
	* Does not make sense to instantiate Animal object
	* move method of Animal class likely abstract because not impossible to implement a move method at Animal class level to fit all subclasses (all animals move in a different way)
* If a class contains abstract methods, class itself must be abstract
<!-- -->
    public abstract class Animal {
        protected String name;
        public Animal(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        // Note method signature ends with a semicolon, and no method body
        // ***
        public abstract String speak();
    }

* NOTE: Cannot instantiate abstract classes!
* **WRONG**
<!-- -->
    a = new Animal(); // Compile error
* **OKAY**
<!-- -->
    Animal a; // All right to use a type

## Interface
* Behaviour specification, collection of method specifications
* Is a reference type
* Class implementing an interface is an is-a relationship, like class inheritance
<!-- -->
    public interface DrivableVehicle {
        // Can contain constants and static methods
        int MAX_SPEED = 150;

        static boolean isSpeedAllowed(int speed){
            return speed <= MAX_SPEED;
        }

        // Method signatures have no curly braces, terminated with a semicolon
        void turn(Direction direction);
        void changeLanes(Direction direction);
        void signalTurn(Direction direction, boolean signalOn);
    }

    // Cannot be instantiated, only implemented
    public class CarModelX implements DrivableVehicle {
        // ...
    }
    // Can be used a type
    DriveableVehicle dv = new CarModelX();
    // Interface can inherit other (multiple) interfaces 
    public interface SelfDrivableVehicle extends DrivableVehicle {
        void goToAutoPilotMode();
    }

## Substitutability
* Every instance of a subclass is an instance of the superclass, but not vice-versa
* An instance of a subclass can be declared as type of superclass

## Dynamic Binding
* Mechanism where method calls in code are resolved at runtime, rather than at compile time
* E.g. overriden methods

## Static Binding
* Early binding
* When a method call is resolved at compile time
* E.g. overloaded methods, overloaded constructors

## Polymorphism
* 1) Substitutability
	- Able to treat objects of different types as one type
* 2) Overriding
	- Objects of different subclasses can display different behaviours in response to same method call
* 3) Dynamic Binding
	- Polymorphic code can call method of parent class and yet execute implementation of child class

## Collection
* Or "container"
* Object that groups multiple elements into a single unit
* Can store, retrieve, manipulate and communicate aggregate data

* Unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections
* Contains:
	1) Interfaces
		- Abstract data types that represent collections
		- Allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation
		- e.g. List<E> interface for ArrayList<E>, LinkedList<E>
	2) Implementations
		- Concerete implementations of collection interfaces
		- Reusable data structures
		- e.g. ArrayList<E> implements List<E> interface
		- e.g. HashMap<K, V> implements Map<K, V> interface
	3) Algorithms
		- Methods that perform useful computations on objects that implement collection interfaces
		- Polymorphic, same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface
		- e.g. sort(List<E>) can sort a collection that implements List<E> interface

## Core Collection interfaces
1) Collection: root of collection hierarchy
2) Set: collection that cannot contain duplicate elements
3) List: ordered collection/sequence
4) Queue: collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing
5) Map: object that maps keys to values

## ArrayList
* Resizable array implementation
<!-- -->
    import java.util.ArrayList;

    ArrayList<String> items = new ArrayList<>();

    items.add("Apple"); // ["Apple"]
    items.contains("Box");
    items.get(2);
    items.size();
    items.clear();

## HashMap
* Collection of key-value pairs
<!-- -->
    import java.awt.Point;
    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Map;

    HashMap<String, Point> points = new HashMap<>();

    points.put("x1", new Point(0, 0));
    pointAsString(points.get("x1")); //[0,0]
    points.containsKey("x1");
    points.containsValue(new Point(0, 0));

    for (Map.Entry<String, Point> entry : points.entrySet()) {
        print(entry.getKey() + " = " + pointAsString(entry.getValue()));
    }
    
_where pointAsString is a method defined_

## Exception Handling
* HANDLE AND RECOVER FROM PROBLEMS (not PREVENT them)
* When error occurs, application may:
    1) request user intervention
    2) recover on its own
    3) log user off/shut down system (extreme cases)

* Exceptions are used to deal with 'unusual' but not entirely unexpected situations encountered during run time
* 3 basic categories of exceptions in Java
    1) **Checked exceptions**
		- Application anticipates and recovers from
		- Catch exception and notify user of mistake
	- **Unchecked exceptions**
	2) Errors
		- Exceptions external to application
		- Application usually cannot anticipate or recover from
		- Indicated by 'Error' and its subclasses
		- e.g. `java.io.IOError`
		- Program might print stack trace and exit
	3) Runtime exceptions
		- Exceptions internal to application
		- Application usually cannot anticipate or recover from
		- Indicated by '`RuntimeException`' and its subclasses
		- e.g. programming bugs, logic errors, improper use of an API
		- e.g. `NullPointerException`

* How exceptions are typically handled
    - When error occurs some point in execution, code being executed creates an exception object
        - Contains info about error (type, state of program)
    - Hands it off to runtime system, i.e. throwing an exception
    - Runtime system tries to find something to handle in call stack
        - Search for method/code that can handle exception, i.e. exception handler
        - Search begines with method in which error occurred and proceeds through call stack in reverse order in which the methods are called
    - When appropriate handler found, runtime system passes the exception to handler
        - Appropriate handler if type of exception object thrown matches the type that can be handled by the handler
        - i.e. catch the exception

* Advantages of exception handling
	- Ability to propogate error info through the call stack
	- Separation of code that deals with 'unusual' situations from code that does the 'usual' work

* `try`-`catch`-`finally` blocks
	- `try`: identifies block of code in which an exception can occur
	- `catch`: identifies block of code (i.e. exception handler) that can handle a particular type of exception
	- `finally`: specify code that is guaranteed to execute with or without the exception
<!-- -->
    public void writeList() {
        print("starting method");
        try {
            print("starting process");
            process();
            print("finishing process"); // will not be printed if exception occurs in process() - does not execute all of try-block
        // Needs at least one catch/finally-block for try-block
        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            print("caught IOOBE");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            print("caught IOE");

        } finally {
            // clean up
            print("cleaning up"); // place to close files, recover resources, clean up after code in try-block
        }
        print("finishing method");
    }

* Class of exception object indicates type of exception thrown
* Exception object can contain further info about error, including error message

* `Throw`-statement
<!-- -->
    if (size == 0) {
        throw new EmptyStackException();
    }

* In Java, Checked exceptions have a "Catch or Specify Requirement"
	- Code that might throw checked exceptions must be enclosed in a try-statement (with handler) or method that specifies that it can throw the exception (with throws-clause that lists exception)
<!-- -->
    public void writeList() throws IOException, IndexOutOfBoundsException {
        print("starting method");
        process();
        print("finishing method");
    }

* Examples
    * 
    <!-- -->
        public class IllegalShapeException extends Exception {
        //no other code needed
        } 
    * `NumberFormatException`
    * `IndexOutOfBoundsException`

## Other notes:
* In Java, a class that does not have any abstract methods can be declared as an abstract class
* Subclass should provide implementations for all abstract methods in superclass or else must be also declared abstract
<!-- -->
    shapesCount++; // Increase count in a method
    Integer newValue = Integer.valueOf(roster.get(day).intValue() + 1);

# Week 1 (Lecture - 16/8)

## Main 2 task scenarios in an internship:
1) Greenfield
	- New product
	- Nothing in the field
	- Likely to be a prototype

2) Brownfield
	- Something that is existing
	- Production

## For this module, need:
1) Retention: remember things you learn
2) Fluency: use the concepts in a way a native speaker uses the language

## Git Fork
1. Fork
2. Clone fork
3. Commit changes
4. Push to fork
5. Can pull directly from remote

## Regressions
- Unintended side-effects of fixing a bug
	- e.g. breaking other code
- Automated regression testing of CLI apps
	- Input and expected output files (compare using command '`FC file1 file2`')
	- To detect unintended changes
